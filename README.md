# Adventure-Works-Sales-Analysis-Project
The Adventure Works company represents a bicycle manufacturer that sells bicycles, clothing, and accessories to global markets. The dataset was provided in Excel Power Tools for Data Analysis course. I started by getting the data in Excel format and then made sure it was accurate and useful by doing some necessary transformations. To bring everything together and make it visually appealing, I used Power BI throughout the process, from loading and transforming the data to creating charts and dashboards.

The heart of the project was creating meaningful visuals that told the story of Adventure Works Store sales. This involved turning the raw data into easy-to-understand charts and graphs. I focused on showcasing important trends and insights to help make business decisions.

In a nutshell, this project demonstrated my skills in handling data, especially using Power BI for analysis and visualization. The end result was a clear and comprehensive overview of Adventure Works Store sales performance, showcasing my ability to turn complex data into valuable insights.
